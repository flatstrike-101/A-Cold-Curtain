ITA_divided_military:0 "Divided Military"
ITA_divided_military_desc:0 "Even before the Second Great War, the Italian Armed Forces have not always been up to standard. There would be incompetence, and inconcistencies throughout the officers and staff, and the equipment would be distributed unequally. With the Second Great War needing utmost diligence and efficiency, the Italian military peaked. But it sharply collapsed post war, as the victory was announced, and the soldiers returned home. Now, it is corrupt and extremley innept, and compared to the great powers of the Soviet Union and Germany, it is a mere toy in the jingoist reality of Europe."
ITA_fallen_king:0 "Fallen King"
ITA_fallen_king_desc:0 "The House of Savoy is not what it once was - Mussolini and his supporters riled a great cause against the monarchs that used to rule. What was once a powerful ruling dynasty, is now the laughingstock of Italian politics. It is rediculed as a symbol of the past, by both the fascists and antifascists. The House of Savoy must perform a miracle to save itself, or perish with the decay of time."
ITA_disfunctional_economy:0 "Disfunctional Economy"
ITA_disfunctional_economy_desc:0 "The Italian economy never recovered from the great depression, and following the many debts that the government took to support the war effort, the economy is in ruins. Unemployment is rising, companies aren't turning out profits, and the competitive, capitalistic market of the West, combined with the closed economies of the East, are both posing environments too hostile to create a stable Italian market. The policies of Il Duce have needs that the economy can't support, and so everyone suffers."
ITA_widespread_corruption:0 "Widespread Corruption and Mafia"
ITA_widespread_corruption_desc:0 "Resulting from even before Italian unification the mafia, and the corruption it brings, have been rampant. But now, it has been spreading. Weak buisnesses, narcissistic politicans and underfunded police forces have lead to the exponential growth of the mafia's influence, with various clans dominating not only regions in Italy, but in the whole Empire, and soon the continent. Corruption, wether social, political or international, has lead to the negligence which now rules the economy, armed forces, and ultimatley the spirit of the Italian people. Hence, Il Duce must crackdown on these mafiosi, or embrace the cold reality, of the corrupted, and over-individualistic  created by the conditions set upon the people of Italy."
ITA_unruly_colonies:0 "Unruly Colonies"
ITA_unruly_colonies_desc:0 "Millions of soldiers died in the Second Great War, and not all of them where Italian. Hundreds of thousands of colonial troops, from Lybia to East Africa served in numerous fronts in service of Italy, and thousands died under the brutal warfare which followed. This is not forgotten by the colonies, and now with the newly annex colonies from the British Empire, solidarity and nationalism is rising at great speeds. More and more soldiers are needed to garrison the colonies, and equipment is needed to arm them against resistance fighters. Il Duce is feared and rules with an iron fist, but that doesn't discourage enraged nationalists from resisting Italian colonization, and it will not stop them from trying to break free."
