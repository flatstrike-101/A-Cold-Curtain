 GER_fuhrer:0 "Führer of the German Reich and People"
 GER_fuhrer_desc:0 "The Führer is our leader. He is our glorious leader, he has lead us through wars, and hasn't yet failed. He has established our great nation, and lifted our people out of poverty. In 1933, people looked at Germany as an impoverished nation. But in 1953, people look at Germany as a great power. Ruler of Western Europe. Conquerer of the Allies. And the greatest Rival to the Soviet Union and the United States of America. None of this would have been possible without him."
 GER_ss_loyalty:0 "Regain SS Loyalty"
 GER_ss_loyalty_desc:0 "The status of the SS has given them great power. And with great power comes responsibility. The SS has none. It acts almost like a second government, it demands weapons and supplies to continue its operations but never tells the high command what these operations are. Although we have gotten assurances from Heydrich and Himmler, we suspect one of them is lying. To stop this disobedience we must regain their loyalty."
 GER_lost_living_space:0 "Lost Living Space"
 GER_lost_living_space_desc:0 "The dream of living space for the Germanic peoples was partially a success. But without the land further east, in the land of the Soviets, the Germanic people are cramped in western Europe. Without space to grow, our economy has also stagnated and started declining. In order for the reich to survive, we must obtain more land for the germanic people."
 GER_soviet_relations:0 "Our Relationship with the Soviets"
 GER_soviet_relations_desc:0 "Our relations with the Soviets are hostile at best. Even after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, our continual announcements about our depising of Communism has not exactly made the Soviet Union kind to us. They are watching for any sign of war, and are determined to stop it in it's tracks."
 GER_declining_economy:0 "Our economy on decline"
 GER_declining_economy_desc:0 "The economy has been on the decline ever since the germanic population outgrew the space it is currently confined to. Without the lebensraum Hitler talked about in the early years of World War II, there isn't enough space for the german people to grow. And thus, the economy is in a slow decline. As even members of our own military alliance are choosing to buy resources and products from alternative suppliers such as the United States or the Soviet Union."
 GER_aftermath_of_tannenbaum:0 "Aftermath of Tannenbaum"
 GER_aftermath_of_tannenbaum_desc:0 "Operation Tannenbaum, the invasion of Switzerland was never thought as an easy task. But once the operation started, the casualties were immensely more than anticipated. Not only that, but many of our armoured vehicles were destroyed in the mountainous terrain of Switzerland. And many of our planes shot out of the sky due to the Swiss having an exceptional Anti-Aircraft defense network. For the Germans, it was a bloodbath."

 germany_main_story.1.t:0 "A Cold Curtain"
 germany_main_story.1.desc:0 "Europe, the home of great powers. In almost constant wars since the time of the romans. What is behind is behind. And the new order, our new order has risen from the ashes of the weak, and faulty German Empire. We are the Greatest Country! We are the thousand year reich. Our power is legendary, and our hold on Europe has not slipped from our iron grasp. Long live the reich!\n\nThere is only one hitch, one nuisance to our control over Europe, The Red Menace. Its shadow glooms over Europe and clouds the east, we cannot see past the curtain, the wall that separates us from those savages. We cannot see the horrors that they commit. They know our power grows, and that when the dust settles, at the dusk of the world. One race will be standing. Ours. The supreme Aryan race.\n\nThe tyrant, and bloodthirsty menace Stalin looks over at our country with bloodlust and jealousy. He sees the greatness that we are, but refuses to hammer out the impurities within his own nation. He refuses to deal with the terrorist-like jews, and their families, he refuses to embrace the true way. The way of the Nazi.\n\nFor these crimes that they have committed, they have forced our hand, and when the time grows near. We will strike and we will vanquish their tyranny. And liberate all the germanic peoples, we will finally have the lebensraum we need, the space we need for the german population to grow and succeed. For we are the greater race, higher than the Poles, the Slavics, and other nuisances. We will be the last to stand. And our grip on europe will be eternal."

 ### FOCUS LOC ###

 GER_two_masters_of_europe:0 "Two Masters of Europe"
 GER_two_masters_of_europe_desc:0 "With Europe in the hands of two powers, our glorious Reich and the Soviet Union, we must ensure victory in the final battle. To do this, we must know our enemy, we must know our friends, and we must most importantly know our assets. Eventually, the time will come for there to no longer be two masters in Europe. And with the death of the Soviet Union, we shall rise from the ashes. And bring our eternal grip on Europe."
 GER_facing_the_reality:0 "Facing the Reality"
 GER_facing_the_reality_desc:0 "The reality of our Reich is much different than we portray ourselves to be to others, and to our citizens. We are starting to see cracks at the seems of our glorious Reich, and we must do everything in order to stop the cracks from spreading. The German people do not know of these threats to our nation, and they will not. The time has come for the Reich to be reborn in the fire and ash of Europe. It is time for the Reich to show the world its greatness. It is time for the Reich to make its own reality!"
 GER_old_allies:0 "Old Allies"
 GER_old_allies_desc:0 "Our old allies; the Italians have all but abandoned us, fearing the greatness of the reich, they have formed their own alliance against us. But they are weak, and everyday we see less and less soldiers protecting their border with us. Perhaps the age of Mussolini's new Roman Empire is over, for it is time for the old to be destroyed and the new to be elevated. Whatever the future holds, we must ensure Italy isn't part of it."
 GER_watch_on_from_north:0 "Watch From the North"
 GER_watch_on_from_north_desc:0 "There has been increasingly less military activity on the Italian side of the border, and many suspect that they are going through a civil war, maybe not a public one, but an internal one. Yet, we are also in dire times, once again the cracks in the Reich are widening, they are weakening us. There will be time to deal with the Italians, but that time is not now."
 GER_detest_their_leader:0 "Detest their Leader"
 GER_detest_their_leader_desc:0 "The Italian Leader, Benito Mussolini was once a friend of Germany. He was welcomed with open arms into the great new world. The new order. But once he betrayed us, we have lost all respect for him. And we increasingly suspect him of telling us lies. We must teach them a lesson, but we lack the resources to do so. It seems not only is Italy falling into chaos, but if we don't stop it. §RGermany will too.§!"
 GER_strengthen_our_border:0 "Strengthen the Border"
 GER_strengthen_our_border_desc:0 "Although our current resources are slim, it seems that the Italians have seen their vulnerabilities in the North, and are reinforcing their positions. We cannot except increased military activity on our border. We must reinforce our positions to send a message to the Italians that we are the masters of Europe not them. But we fear that we are feeding out of their palms, possibly stepping into a snare, and setting off the trap."
 GER_never_again:0 "Never Again"
 GER_never_again_desc:0 "Although it is enticing to reform the alliance that brought Germany and Italy to greatness, we fear that the Italians are too foolish and too jealous of our current holdings. We must not let loose our grip on Europe, and therefore we must not show weakness. By joining the Italians, we would show weakness. The german high command has decided it is time to cut the cord. It is time to stop diplomatic communication with the treacherous Italians."
 GER_enemies_to_the_east:0 "Enemies to the East"
 GER_enemies_to_the_east_desc:0 "We may be surrounded by enemies, but the most dangerous ones of all are to the east. The red scare. They mock us, they embarrass us, they rival us. One day, the time will come for Germany to show where it stands in the world, and obliterate the socialist bastards! We will never bow to the oppression and bloodlust of Stalin! For the future ahead will be one without the Soviet Union."
 GER_land_lost:0 "Land Lost"
 GER_land_lost_desc:0 "Although World War II lead to mass gains in territory for the Reich, it is still cramped for the Germanic peoples. Without places to spread, and expand, the Germanic peoples are left restrained, unable to achieve the greatness that is inside them. The land we need lies to the East, under the banner of the Soviet Union, one day we will conquer the land. And that day will be the birth of a new Germany, unrestrained by space, and undefeated by war."
 GER_cramped_in_the_fatherland:0 "Cramped in the Fatherland"
 GER_cramped_in_the_fatherland_desc:0 "The fatherland that our glorious leader Hitler has built is a land of wonders, and prosperity. But the German population is growing, and without growing space. Without the growing space needed, the German population would be limited, our eceonomy would become stagnant, and the glorious Reich would be left restrained. We must ensure this does not happen."
 GER_dream_of_lebensraum:0 "Dreams of Lebensraum"
 GER_dream_of_lebensraum_desc:0 "An idea, first thought of during World War II. We ignored it. The idea of lebensraum for the Germanic people, we believed we did not need any more space for the Germanic peoples to grow and prosper. But we were wrong. And now we are left dreaming about the missed opportunity of the space in the east where Soviet oppression lies. But soon our dreams will become reality for us, and nightmares for the Soviets."
 GER_what_could_have_been:0 "What Could Have Been"
 GER_what_could_have_been_desc:0 "Our eyes have been set on Moscow ever since the invasion of Poland, there is not enough space in the reich, and we know it. We missed many opportunities to strike when the Soviets were weak but feared the vast amount of land needed to be conquered for the Soviets to give in. We feared the cost of the war. But now we know there is nothing to fear. Germany is far superior to the red menaces in Moscow. One day we will take Moscow. And no longer wonder 'What could have been?'"
 GER_war_planning:0 "War planning"
 GER_war_planning_desc:0 "Although the state of the reich is not the most stable at the moment, we must begin planning the invasion of Russia, lest we run out of growing space for the Germanic peoples. We must begin the invasion of Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad, Kiev, and Minsk. And we shall not be stopped along the way. Our offense will be relentless, it will send the Soviets reeling. Although the Soviets don't know it. Their days are numbered."
 GER_convene_the_ckw:0 "Convene the OKW"
 GER_convene_the_ckw_desc:0 "In order for our offense in Russia to be successful, we must consult the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. Currently our OKW is Wilhelm Keitel, an experienced general who will be able to guide our hand and take us to Moscow. Without the help of the OKW, the invasion will not be possible. We must ensure that he is willing to assist us."
 GER_our_final_war:0 "The Final War"
 GER_our_final_war_desc:0 "The final war will be between us and the Soviets. We already know the outcome, but we must know how to get there. Once we set foot on the Soviet Union, there will be no stopping the German warmachine. We will cut through the Soviet Union like a sythe cutting through grass. Our movements will be swift and effective. We will show the world, the new age of combat. And most importantly turn the page in history to the thousand year reich!"
